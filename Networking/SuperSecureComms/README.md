# The Flag
CHAD{r0t13_!5_sup3r_s3cuR3_@nD_i_l0v3_!t!}

# Solution
Open the pcap with Wireshark.  

Statistics -> Conversations -> (192.168.70.130 <-> 192.168.70.131)
Parse through the various plaintext conversations to get two halves of a flag that are "encrypted" with ROT13:
PUNQ{e0g13_!5_fhc3e_f3phE3_@aQ_v_y0i3_!g!}

# Description

Hey, bro. You're good with computers, right? Can you see if my comms are secure?

*Remember the flag is in CHAD{flag} format*
