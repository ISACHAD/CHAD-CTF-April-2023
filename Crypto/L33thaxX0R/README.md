# Flag
CHAD{tH15_i5_h0w_d@v1d_5ec3res_@ll_h1s_em@ils}

# One of many solutions
Open ghidra and poke around. FUN_004152B0 is where the entire challenge is located.

Participants should be able to see a bunch of hex that they can convert to hex. This string is the "encrypted flag" and there should clearly be a "key" that  
is then used to produce the decrypted flag via XOR.

# Description

This crypto library fell off the back of David's truck. He swears that this library uses only the most secure techniques. Can you figure out what this technique is so that you can steal his flag?

*Remember the flag is in CHAD{flag} format*
