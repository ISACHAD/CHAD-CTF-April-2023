# Nothing in Porticular
**Exploitation - Easy**

Wyatt Tauber

## Challenge

Find the CHAD Apache web server. Our last scans show it was in the TCP range 16000-17000.

### Hint 1
Skip host discovery as we know the host is up and be sure to run version detection. Remember to limit the scan range to TCP 16000-17000. `grep` may help.

### Flag
`CHAD{nm4p_15_c00l}`

## Exploit Overview

Port scanning is often the start of exploitation activities on a box. In addition to identifying open ports, it can often identify which services are running on them if they are common (like Apache).

## Solve Challenge

Scan the box with `nmap`, a well-known port scanning utility. `grep` the output for "Apache".

```
wyatt@WYATT-DESKTOP:~$ nmap -Pn -sV -p 16000-17000 0.cloud.chals.io
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-04-01 21:31 EDT

PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

The flag is the only text on the website, `CHAD{nm4p_15_c00l}`.
