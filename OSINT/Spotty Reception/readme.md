# Spotty Reception
**OSINT - Easy**

Wyatt Tauber

## Challenge

The CTF lead was trying to stream his Release Radar on the train home, but the Wi-Fi kept dropping and now he can only listen to his saved playlists... :(

At least he has good taste, right?

### Hint 1
	Wyatt has an interesting Spotify playlist. What's up with the order of the songs?

### Flag
`CHAD{SIMPLEoSINT#1}`

## Challenge Overview
This challenge tests some basic situational awareness and the ability to understand puns.

Participants should see the references to Spotify and also know that the CTF Lead is Wyatt.

Wyatt has his Spotify linked to his Discord profile.


The first playlist that shows up is [CHAD{ Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7mT56E2cI6DqiuQf0vo2Xx).

Examining the playlist, participants should note the opening bracket of the flag in the title and the closing bracket in the song "}{".

The first letters of each song in the playlist make up the flag.
