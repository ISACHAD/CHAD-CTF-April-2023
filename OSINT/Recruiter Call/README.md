## Challenge

**This challenge involves Mr. Bolouri. Active reconaissance is allowed for this challenge only.**

I just redid my voicemail to see how it sounds to recruiters. Could you check it out and give me some feedback?

### Hint 1
Peep my GitHub!

### Hint 2
Let it go to voicemail, then wait for a bit.

### Flag
`CHAD{r1ng_r1ng}`

Updated to `CHAD{g4b3_m3_4_j0b}` or `CHAD{g4v3_m3_4_j0b}` on 4/14 1054 due to William B. (Kono) posting the flag in #chad-general.

## Technique Overview

This challenge involves a slightly more in-depth search of online platforms.

## Solve challenge:

View Jackson's GitHub page. See that he has a repository called "Resume". This contains a PDF document with contact information.

Jackson's phone number is (585) 204-7604. Call the number.

After a typical voicemail message, he reads the flag: `CHAD{r1ng_r1ng}`
