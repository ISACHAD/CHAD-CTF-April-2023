## Challenge

Flags will usually be in the format `CHAD{<flag in l33tsp34k>}`.

Flags may be obfuscated or have additional characters to prevent cheating. Remember to format them as `CHAD{<flag in l33tsp34k>} ` before submitting.

Trivia, programming, and open-ended questions do not use flags. These kinds of submissions may need to be manually graded.

Some challenges have a limited number of attempts when bruteforcing may be possible. This will be specified in the instructions.

Some challenges must be solved before unlocking further challenges in the category. If you solve one of these, you'll see the next one unlock. There are 2 easy, 2 medium, and 1 hard challenge for most categories.

You may take hints for some challenges. Each hint will reduce the difficulty and may cost points, if you have enough to spend on the hint. The deduction is specified on the Hint button and varies by challenge difficulty. If there is no point deduction specified, the hint is free. Try it with the first hint below!

In general, each hint is intended to reduce the challenge 1/2 to 1 difficulty level. You can always ask the challenge authors questions as well by asking in the #chad-general channel or by sending them a DM.

The first flag was in the breifing!

### Hint 1
This is an example of a free hint. Don't click the next hint button unless you want a 1 point deduction on this challenge!

### Hint 2
This is an example of a hint with deduction. You lost 1 point on this challenge by clicking it.

### Flag
`CHAD{f1rst_fl4g}`

## Solution
The flag is in Hint 2.
