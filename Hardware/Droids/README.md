Attached is a Verilog hardware description of a module containing asynchronous logic. Your task is to analyze this module, and produce a truth table. You will enter the truth table as a comma separated list. An example is below.

F(A, B, C) = !(A+C)+(A*!B)

A    B    C    F(A, B, C)
0    0    0     1
0    0    1     1
0    1    0     0
0    1    1     0
1    0    0     1
1    0    1     0
1    1    0     1
1    1    1     0

The correct answer would then be formatted as follows:
1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0
