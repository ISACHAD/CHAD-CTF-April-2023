Included is a schematic. Your task is to find the resistance of R4, given the following facts:

R1 has a resistance of 10kΩ.
The current through R3 into node B is 0.8mA.
The voltage between node A and ground is 2.6V, and the voltage between A and B is 1.6V.
Vcc is 5V.

Round your response to two decimal places. Do not include an Ω symbol, just the SI notation representing order of magnitude. Examples of responses are below.

8.88m
7.77
6.66k
5.55M
