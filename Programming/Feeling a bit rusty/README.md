## Feeling a bit rusty?
We all love python, but sometimes its good to branch out and try new things!

If you have never written rust before, take these challenges as a way to dip your toes into the world of rust.

Here is the situation:
Want to paint a bunch of boxes for our CTF. Its your job to figure out how much paint we need to paint all of the boxes. 

The facts: 
We can only buy gallons of paint of our favorite color, and each gallon can cover 400 square feet. So we need to find the surface area of all of my boxes.

The input is a string of boxes, with x's seperating the dimmensions and commas seperating the boxes.
ex: `"9x4x2, 12x5x13, 14x5x6"`

I have setup the input for you, feel free to install rust on you on computer and develop in a better environment. It is super easy to setup and you can find how to compile and run rust here: https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started.
